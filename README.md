Hi, I’m **RadoTheProgrammer**

I get started in github.
I love programming. Take a look at my pinned repos.

I'm currently making projects in python. See [my trello board](https://trello.com/b/PL60e9hC/coding-projects) to get an overview of my coding projects, my future ideas, in progress, and my best projects.
