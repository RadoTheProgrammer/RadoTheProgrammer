Hi, I’m **RadoTheProgrammer**

I get started in github.
I love programming. My best projects:[motsmeles](https://github.com/RadoTheProgrammer/motsmeles), [dcdljeu](https://github.com/RadoTheProgrammer/dcdljeu), [pygame_snake](https://github.com/RadoTheProgrammer/pygame_snake), [mygoogletrans](https://github.com/RadoTheProgrammer/mygoogletrans)
I'm currently making projects in python. See [my trello board](https://trello.com/b/PL60e9hC/coding-projects) to get an overview of my coding projects, my future ideas, in progress, and my best projects.
